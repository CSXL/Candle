package main

// Write a program that creates a shell that responds to the "about", "exit", and "get-info <stock>" commands.
// This program should be written with only standard libraries.
// The "about" command should print out the name of the program "Candle CLI" and the company "CSX Labs".
// The "exit" command should exit the program.
// The "get-info <stock>" command should print out a mock value for the stock.
